While running your local server open another terminal window in the same folder and run the following command:


                npx pa11y-ci http://localhost:4000/....


where that last argument is the url on your running localhost of the page you want to check.

You should always test new pages locally before attempting to merge them into *main*.  You don't want to waste time trying to figure out why your Federalist Pull Request fails when you should have fixed it before you tried to merge the page remotely.
