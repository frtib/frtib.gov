## Participant Surveys

We are continually seeking ways to improve the services offered by the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and to increase participation in the Plan. We conduct annual TSP Participant Surveys to measure participant satisfaction with TSP features, services, and communications. The Surveys also gauge participant interest in possible new services and investment options.

Survey respondents are randomly selected, and all individual responses are confidential.
