## Employee Surveys

The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) was administered from September 24, 2020 to November 5, 2020, and a total of 183 (74%) Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) employees responded to the survey. Below is a summary of what has been identified as our Agency's strengths, challenges, and areas of progress.


##### Strengths
FRTIB has clear strengths in the areas of work experience, health and safety, work-life balance, work quality, and establishing alignment between employees' work and the goals of the agency. These items were the highest overall positive responses:

- 92% of employees said that they are protected from health and safety hazards on the job (Q15).
- 90% of employees know how their work relates to the agency's goals (Q7).
- 90% of employees said supervisors support their need to balance work and other life issues (Q19).
- 89% of employees felt satisfied with FRITB’s alternative work schedule programs (Q60).
- 88% of employees said their supervisor in their work unit supports employee development (Q21).


In addition to the five items above, 39 additional items were identified as strengths.


##### Challenges

FRTIB employees are less satisfied with steps taken to support Child and Elder Care Programs as well as steps taken to deal with poor performers. These were the highest overall negative responses:

Only 39% of employees said that they were satisfied with FRTIB’s Child Care Programs (Q63).
Only 40% of employees said that they were satisfied with the Elder Care Programs (Q64).
While improvement was seen in comparison with 2019 results, only 53% of employees said that steps were not taken in their work unit to deal with poor performers who could not or would not improve (Q10).


No additional items were identified as challenges.


##### Areas of Progress

There were several areas where the results improved from the previous year. FRTIB employees are satisfied with the information they receive from management and feel managers communicate and evaluate the goals of the organization. They also feel that physical conditions allow them to perform their job well and understood what they had to do to be rated at the different performance levels. These were the largest increases in positive responses:

- 71% of employees felt encouraged to come up with new and better ways of doing things (Q2). This was a 5-point increase from the previous year.
- 86% of employees felt the people they work with cooperate to get the job done (Q9). This was an 10-point increase from the previous year.
- 83% of employees said managers communicate the goals of the organization (Q28). This was a 10-point increase from the previous year.
- 54% of employees felt that senior leaders generate high levels of motivation and commitment in the workforce (Q26). This was a 14-point increase from the previous year.
- 88% of employees said that FRTIB is successful at accomplishing its mission (Q16). This was an 10-point increase from the previous year.



There were a total of 36 items that increased since 2019.

The results received from the Federal Employee Viewpoint Surveys remain an important component of the Agency's ongoing commitment to ensuring FRTIB is a great place to work where great work gets done, and the Agency will continue to analyze these results to build off of our strengths and improve challenge areas.
