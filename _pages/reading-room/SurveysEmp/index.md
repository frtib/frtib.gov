## Employee Surveys

The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) was administered from July 7, 2022, to July 22, 2022.  During this period, 161 FRTIB employees responded to the survey for an overall FRTIB response rate of 64.4%.  All FRTIB FEVS-eligible employees were encouraged to share their voice and participate in the annual survey. Below is a summary of our agency’s strengths, challenges, and areas of progress.

### Strengths

FRTIB showed clear strengths in the areas of work-life balance, supervisor and employee engagement,
and the needs of our customers. These items were the highest overall positive responses:  

-	93% of employees said supervisors supported their needs to balance work and other life issues (Q47).
-	94% of employees said their supervisor treats them with respect (Q49).
-	93% of employees felt their supervisor holds them accountable for achieving results (Q51).
-	92% of employees felt their supervisors listens to what they have to say (Q48).
-	92% of employees felt employees met the needs of their customers (Q19).


71 items overall were identified as strengths (65% positive or higher). This is 31 more strengths than the previous year.


### Challenges

While no items were technically identified as challenges (35% negative or higher responses), the greatest negative responses were in areas involving senior leaders and the impact of these survey results.   

-	33% of employees felt their senior leaders did not generate high levels of motivation and commitment in the workplace (Q55).  
-	31% of employees felt management did not involve them in decisions that affect their work (Q64).  This was an 8-point increase in negative responses from the previous year.
-	26% of employees did not have a high level of respect for their organization’s senior leaders (Q60). This was a 1-point increase in negative responses from the previous year.
-	24% of employees felt their organization’s senior leaders did not maintain high standards of honesty and integrity (Q56). This was a 7-point decrease in negative responses from the previous year.
-	31% of employees believed the results of this survey will not be used to make our agency a better place to work (Q44). This was a 11-point increase in negative responses from the previous year.


### Areas of Progress

There were several areas where FRTIB’s results improved from the previous year. The greatest increases in positive responses were in areas involving support for work-life programs, senior leaders, and overall job satisfaction:

-	66% of employees felt senior leaders demonstrate support for Work-Life Programs (Q61). This was a 12-point increase from the previous year.
-	52% of employees felt senior leaders generated a high level of motivation and commitment in the workplace (Q55). This was a 5-point increase from the previous year.
