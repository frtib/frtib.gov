## Employee Surveys

The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) was administered from May 16, 2023, to July 14, 2023. During this open period, 177 FRTIB employees responded to the survey for an overall FRTIB response rate of 74.4%.  All FRTIB FEVS-eligible employees were encouraged to share their voice and participate in the annual survey. Below is a summary of our agency’s strengths, challenges, and areas of progress.
