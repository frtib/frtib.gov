## E-FOIA Requirements

The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 (E-FOIA) require that agencies permit the public to inspect and copy records that are likely to become the subject of later FOIA requests, provided the records were (1) created after November 1, 1996, and (2) released under FOIA on or after March 31, 1997. E-FOIA stipulates that agencies make copies of such records available via computer telecommunications beginning November 1, 1997.
