## Accessibility: Notice of Rights

### Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. § 794d)

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 508) requires all electronic and information technology (also referred to as information and communication technology or ICT) that is developed, procured, maintained, or used by a federal agency to be accessible to people with disabilities. Examples of ICT include web sites, telephones, multimedia devices, and copiers. Access available to individuals with disabilities must be comparable to access available to others. Standards for Section 508 compliance are developed and maintained by the United States Access Board. Further information about the Access Board's standards and Section 508 generally may be found at <www.section508.gov>.

If you have questions about the EEOC's Section 508 program supporting ICT, e-mail  <508coordinator@eeoc.gov>. For information about filing a complaint against the EEOC under Section 508, contact the Office of Equal Opportunity at (202) 291-2945 or <contact_oeo@eeoc.gov>. To file a complaint against another agency, contact that agency's Section 508 Coordinator. Contact information for Section 508 Coordinators may be found at <https://www.section508.gov/tools/coordinator-listing>.

### Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. §§ 4151--57)

The Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) requires access to facilities that are designed, built, altered, or leased with Federal funds. The Access Board is the federal agency responsible for enforcing the ABA. The Access Board's accessibility standards are available on their website at <https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-aba-standards>, and information about filing a complaint may be found at <https://www.access-board.gov/aba-enforcement/file-a-complaint>.
