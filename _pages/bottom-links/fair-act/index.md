## FAIR Act

The “Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998” (FAIR Act) directs Federal agencies to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) an inventory of all their commercial activities that are performed by Federal employees. OMB reviews each agency’s Commercial Activities Inventory and consults with the agency regarding its content. Upon the completion of this review and consultation, the agency is required to transmit a copy of the inventory to Congress and make it available to the public on the Agency website. The specific data to be posted is described in section 2(c) of the FAIR Act.

The required information is below.
