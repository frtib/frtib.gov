## Federal Employees Training

### Pre-Onboarding Training

There are no training requirements of Federal employees in-advance of their Entrance on Duty (EoD) date.

New hires will complete both IT Rules of Behavior (ITRoB) and Cybersecurity (SETA) training electronically upon receipt of their new laptop.

Please visit the other sections of the FRTIB Onboarding page for information to support a successful onboarding experience to include forms completion and information that is pertinent for New Employee Orientation.
