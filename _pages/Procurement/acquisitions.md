<h3>Acquisition Thresholds</h3>
<p>
FRTIB’s Micro Purchase Threshold (MPT) is $15,000; our Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is $250,000.

<!-- START Contracting Methods -->
<h3>Contracting Methods</h3>
  <p>
  FRTIB primarily uses Contracting by Negotiation (FAR Part 15) and Simplified Acquisition Procedures (FAR Part 13); FRTIB does not use Sealed Bidding methods (FAR Part 14).
  </p>

  <!--start accordion -->
  <div class="usa-accordion usa-accordion--bordered">
    <!-- Use the accurate heading level to maintain the document outline -->
    <h4 class="usa-accordion__heading">
      <button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="negotiation">
        Contracting By Negotiation
      </button>
    </h4>
    <div id="negotiation" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
      <p>
      Negotiations are exchanges, in either a competitive or sole source environment, between the Government and offerors that are undertaken with the intent of allowing the offeror to revise its proposal. When negotiations are conducted in a competitive acquisition, they take place after the competitive range has been established, and are called discussions.</p>
      <p>
      The discussions with each offeror in the competitive range should help the offeror prepare a final proposal revision that will provide the best value for FRTIB. Then FRTIB will evaluate the revised proposals to determine which proposal offers the overall best value.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="usa-accordion__heading">
      <button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="simplified">
        Simplified Acquisition Procedures
      </button>
    </h4>
    <div id="simplified" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
      <p>
      Simplified Acquisitions use a set of procedures designed to make it easier to purchase supplies and services that are under certain thresholds by expediting the evaluation processes and keeping documentation to a minimum.</p>
      <p> FRTIB uses Simplified Acquisitions Procedures to the maximum extent practicable for all purchases of supplies and services not exceeding $250,000, the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT).
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!--END accordion -->
<!-- END Contracting Methods -->

<h3>Other Types of Contracts and Purchase Orders</h3>
  <p>
  FRTIB uses the General Services Administration’s (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), including NASA’s Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement, to place orders for goods and services directly with contractors.
  </p>
  <p>
  Many of FRTIB’s requirements are competed using GSA schedules and competitive GWACs because these are streamlined instruments including price lists and pre-negotiated terms. These vehicles help meet FRTIB’s contracting needs because they are more efficient and include a diverse mix of vendors.
