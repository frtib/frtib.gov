## Why work at FRTIB

<p>  
The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) is a great place to work; and a place where great work gets done.  We are an independent Federal agency responsible for administering the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) which is considered to be one of the best retirement plans in the world and a model for defined contribution plans. We are a diverse group of individuals with a shared focus on helping our participants achieve their desired retirement outcomes.  Do you want to make a lasting impact on the lives of our participants?  Join the FRTIB and help millions of civilian employees and members of the uniformed services prepare for one of the most significant financial decisions they will make in their lifetime, help them (and you) retire with dignity!
