Voted three years in a row as one of the "Best Places to Work in the Federal Government" as ranked by the Partnership for Public Service Best Places to Work Rankings, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) is an independent Federal Agency with a single mission: To administer the Thrift Savings Plan solely in the interest of its participants and beneficiaries.  We help Federal employees and members of the Uniformed Services retire with dignity by providing benefits similar to private sector 401(k) plans. The TSP manages over $390 billion for more than 4.6 million participants located in every time zone around the world.
