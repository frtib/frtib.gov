## Work/Life Balance and Wellness

We understand the balancing act between work and personal life. The FRTIB offers a comprehensive benefits package that includes paid time off*, life insurance, health benefits, and participation in the 3-tier federal retirement system. We offer work/life-balance flexibilities that may be right for you. We offer, if applicable:
