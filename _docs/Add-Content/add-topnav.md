Adding to the top nav is a big deal.  There is limited space on desktop. Make sure you view the change on desktop of several phone sizes the make sure it looks good.

Usually done as part of the add page step.

The top nav is controlled by top_navigation in _data/navigation.yml.
(Maybe this should be a page about what each nav is in the file.)
