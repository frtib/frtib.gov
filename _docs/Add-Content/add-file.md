Most files have a place in the reading room or footer where they show up.

To add a file in the page content do ... (seperate doc page?)

1. make branch

TASK#######-???????-user

2. place file in folder in _pdf/...

Location of file depends on which page you want the file to show up on

3. edit reading-room-files.yml

4. send preview link to requestor

5. merge brnach with main
